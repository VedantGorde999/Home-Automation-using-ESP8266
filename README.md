# Smart Home Automation with NodeMCU ESP8266

## Introduction

In the modern digital age, smart homes have become increasingly popular due to their convenience, efficiency, and potential for energy savings. This project utilizes NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers and relay modules to create a smart home system. By integrating with voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa, this system allows for both manual and voice-controlled management of home appliances.

## Background

The NodeMCU ESP8266 is a versatile and cost-effective microcontroller ideal for DIY IoT projects. When combined with a 4-channel relay module, it can control multiple electrical appliances. This setup, coupled with voice assistants, enhances user interaction through natural language commands, making home automation more accessible and user-friendly.

## Problem Statement

Traditional home automation often relies on manual controls or smartphone apps, which may not be intuitive for all users. Additionally, limitations of free-tier cloud services can restrict the number of devices that can be controlled, complicating system expansion.

## Objective

- Develop a smart home system using NodeMCU ESP8266 and relay modules.
- Enable control via Google Assistant and Alexa.
- Provide a cost-effective solution to overcome cloud service limitations.
- Ensure modularity for future feature expansion and community collaboration.

## Proposed Solution

The system integrates NodeMCU ESP8266 with a 4-channel relay module, allowing control of electrical appliances through both manual switches and voice commands. Utilizing Sinric Proâ€™s free tier, users can control up to three devices per room via voice commands.

## Deliverables

- Implementation of the smart home system with NodeMCU ESP8266 and relay modules.
- Voice control integration with Google Assistant and Alexa.
- User manual and setup documentation.
- Demonstration of both manual and voice-controlled device operations.

## Hardware Required

- NodeMCU ESP8266
- 4-channel 5V SPDT Relay Module
- Switch Buttons
- Rainbow Wire
- Bulbs
