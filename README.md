# Home Automation IoT Project

## Overview

This project is a home automation system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to control and monitor various aspects of a home environment. The system integrates with multiple IoT devices, allowing users to automate tasks such as lighting, temperature control, and security monitoring through a central interface.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Control devices like lights, thermostats, and security cameras from anywhere.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Set schedules for device operations (e.g., turn lights on at sunset).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor the status of devices and receive notifications about system events.
- **Customizable Rules**: Create custom rules for device interactions based on triggers (e.g., motion detected, temperature threshold).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (for Arduino-based projects)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if using Python for server-side code)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if using JavaScript for the frontend or backend)

### Installation
